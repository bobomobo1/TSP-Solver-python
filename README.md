# TSP-Solver-python
An implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization on the Traveling Salesman Problem. This was done as an assignment for COIS-4550.

* Produces a random set of points on a graph (0,100)
* Uses a PSO(Partical Swarm Optimization) algorithm to caluculate the quickest route
* Generates matplotlib animations to visualize the algorithm

## Swarm Intelligence

Swarm intelligence is an AI technique developed from studying real life occurrences. It is easy to about the general idea of swarm intelligence when it is related to an a school of fish. The school of fish has many individuals, isn't under control, but is self-organized as a whole. 

Key characteristics of swarm intelligence:
* Has many individuals
* Doesn't have a controler - decentralized
* Usually consists of 1 type of individual
* Individuals interact with each other and the environment
* Those interactions are what creates a self-organizing system which forms the results

Unique possibilities arise due to the techniques property of forming organized results, while not having a controller. It is a group of simple individuals, that become intelligent as a group. Also, even if a subgroup of individuals fail, the likelyhood of still getting results are still high.
